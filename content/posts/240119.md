[MachineGames Unveils First Look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Xbox Direct 2024](https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-unveils-first-look-at-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-direct-2024)

Great news for Indiana Jones fans! A new game based on the franchise is set to be released in 2024. Players will be able to enjoy the game on both PS5 and Steam. Although I haven't played any games developed by MachineGames yet, I enjoy playing games published by Bethesda. So, I am really excited to try this one! I haven't seen the latest Indiana Jones film, so I am planning to watch it soon.
