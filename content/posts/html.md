[Recapturing early-internet whimsy with HTML - MIT technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/21/1084525/internet-whimsy-html-energy/)

In the 2000s, the internet was free than now. People created their websites to write diaries, poems, and jokes. Many people communicated with funny sometimes stupid jokes and spent a lot of data for them.

The purpose of creating or viewing a website and interacting with others was not to earn money. However, now the primary purpose revolves around making money, whether users like it or not.
Now our internet life is full of ads, spam, or awful something just like them. It’s just pretty sad, isn’t it?
